# Proof-Reading-Rewriter
This software is developed as a web application in Django. So to use the interface, you must have Python 3+ installed on your machine.
Go to the mysite directory and type 'python3 manage.py runserver' on linux terminal and on Windows if you have more than one version of 
Python installed. Otherwise if you have Windows platform and only python3 installed on it, type 'python manage.py runserver'. Install NLTK 
and word_forms librararies and make sure you have an internet connection. Then go to your browser and type 127.0.0.1/polls and hit enter.
Happy rewriting!!!
